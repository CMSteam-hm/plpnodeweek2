### File System Operations Script in Node.js

#### Overview:
This Node.js script performs various file system operations including creating a directory, generating multiple files with random content, reading and displaying file content, and deleting specific files based on a condition. Error handling is implemented to handle potential issues gracefully.

#### Instructions:

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - This script requires the following npm packages:
     - `fs.promises`: Included in Node.js standard library.
     - `path`: Included in Node.js standard library.
     - `uuid`: For generating random content (`npm install uuid`).

3. **Running the Script:**
   - Save the script to a file, e.g., `fileSystemOperations.js`.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `fileSystemOperations.js`.
   - Run the script using Node.js:
     ```bash
     node fileSystemOperations.js
     ```

4. **Tasks Performed:**
   - **Create Directory:** Creates a directory named `myDirectory`.
   - **Create Files:** Generates 5 files (`file1.txt` to `file5.txt`) within `myDirectory` with random content.
   - **Read and Display Files:** Reads and displays the content of each file in `myDirectory`.
   - **Delete Files:** Deletes files in `myDirectory` based on a condition (e.g., files starting with 'file').

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Errors such as directory already exists, file not found, permission denied, etc., are handled using try-catch blocks.
   - Specific error codes (`'EEXIST'` for directory existence) are checked and appropriate actions are taken.

6. **Adjustments:**
   - Modify the script to change the number of files created, adjust conditions for file deletion, or enhance error handling based on specific requirements.

### Express.js Application with User Authentication

#### Overview:
This Express.js application includes user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), implements security best practices such as input validation, protection against common vulnerabilities, HTTPS, and secure headers.

#### Instructions:

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - This application uses several npm packages including:
     - `express`: Web framework for Node.js.
     - `jsonwebtoken`: For JWT token generation and verification.
     - `bcryptjs`: For hashing passwords securely.
     - `body-parser`: Middleware for parsing request bodies.
     - `helmet`: For setting secure HTTP headers.
     - `express-validator`: For input validation and sanitization.
     - `dotenv`: For loading environment variables.

3. **Running the Application:**
   - Clone or download the project files.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Install dependencies using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
     ```plaintext
     PORT=3000
     JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey
     ```
     Replace `mysecretkey` with your desired JWT secret key.
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

4. **Endpoints:**
   - **POST `/api/auth/register`:** Register a new user. Requires `username` and `password` in the request body.
   - **POST `/api/auth/login`:** Authenticate and login a user. Requires `username` and `password` in the request body.
   - **Authentication:** JWT tokens are used for authentication. Include the token in the `Authorization` header for protected routes.

5. **Security Features:**
   - **Input Validation:** Implemented using `express-validator` middleware to validate and sanitize input data.
   - **Protection Against Vulnerabilities:** Uses `helmet` middleware for setting secure HTTP headers, ensuring HTTPS connections, and validating inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities.
   - **Secure Headers:** Automatically set by `helmet` middleware to mitigate common security vulnerabilities.

6. **Security Audit:**
   - Perform security audits using tools like `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
   - Use OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) or similar tools to perform automated security testing against your application.
